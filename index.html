                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Nathan Phillip Smith has been teaching piano lessons in Orem, UT for over a decade.  
                    He got his start in piano at a young age and traveled internationally to perform in 
                    Chile, Peru, Germany, Austria, and South Africa. Nathan competed in and placed in 
                    competitions throughout his youth and is a former board member of the Utah 
                    International Youth Piano Competition.  Nathan's most current work includes studying 
                    piano performance at Utah Valley University, and releasing his first album, 
                    Beautiful Day. He has been played on the radio both locally and internationally. 

                    Nathan is a registered teacher through Music Teachers National Association (MTNA). 
                    His belief is that a successful pianist should learn repertoire, music theory, 
                    technique, music history, sight reading, and ear training. These areas are the focus 
                    for each lesson in the studio. Nathan believes that with these pillars of learning 
                    students will not only progress in their skill, but foster a love for the piano and 
                    good music. We look forward to meeting with you to determine our compatibility as 
                    student and teacher. 
                    
                    Thank you!</p>
